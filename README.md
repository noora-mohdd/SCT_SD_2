# SkillCraft Technology Internship Task

This repository contains a project completed during my internship as a Software Development Intern at **SkillCraft Technology**. This task focuses on enhancing my skills in Python programming, logic building, and basic user input handling.

## Task 2: Number Guessing Game

This repository contains a Python program that generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it. The game provides interactive feedback and includes input validation to ensure a smooth user experience. The game continues until the user chooses to stop playing.

---

## How the Game Works

- The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- The user is prompted to guess the number.
- After each guess, the program provides feedback:
  - If the guess is too low → *"Too low! Try again."*
  - If the guess is too high → *"Too high! Try again."*
  - If the guess is correct → *"Yes! You got it!"*
- After winning, the user is asked if they want to play again.
- The game also includes input validation to handle non-integer entries gracefully using a `try-except` block.
- After the game ends, it shows how many guesses it took and gives feedback based on performance.

## Features

- Random number generation between 1 and 100.
- Unlimited gameplay until the user opts out.
- Input validation with error handling for non-integer inputs.
- Feedback after each guess to help guide the player.
- Tracks the number of guesses and gives a final message based on performance.
- **this project is built using only core Python libraries (`random`)**.

## sample output

guess a number (1-100): hello
please enter a valid number, not text.
guess a number (1-100): 120
enter a valid number
guess a number (1-100): 60
too low! try again
guess a number (1-100): 80
too high! try again
guess a number (1-100): 75
too high! try again
guess a number (1-100): 70
too high! try again
guess a number (1-100): 67
too low! try again
guess a number (1-100): 69
yes you got it!
you won!
do you want to play again?(y/n): n
amount of guesses it took = 6
Good Job!
